\chapter{Third-Party Code and Libraries}

%If you have made use of any third party code or software libraries, i.e. any code that you have not designed and written yourself, then you must include this appendix. 

%As has been said in lectures, it is acceptable and likely that you will make use of third-party code and software libraries. The key requirement is that we understand what is your original work and what work is based on that of other people. 

%Therefore, you need to clearly state what you have used and where the original material can be found. Also, if you have made any changes to the original versions, you must explain what you have changed. 

%As an example, you might include a definition such as: 

%Apache POI library – The project has been used to read and write Microsoft Excel files (XLS) as part of the interaction with the client’s existing system for processing data. Version 3.10-FINAL was used. The library is open source and it is available from the Apache Software Foundation. The library is released using the Apache License \cite{apache_license}. This library was used without modification.

The software CV Drone has been used in this project to generate AT Commands that are sent to the drone, as well as handling UDP/TCP connection and including OpenCV for use with the drone. This software is open source and available from github\cite{CVDrone}. The software is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License\cite{GNULGPL}. The only modification made to this software was to increase the video quality provided, this modification involved commenting line 105 out and un-commenting line 107 in the file "ardrone/command.cpp" of this library.\\



This software also includes the OpenCV library, which provides implementations of computer vision libraries. This has been used for any computer vision being performed within this project as well as the provision of data types such as Point2f and Mat. OpenCV is open source and available from the OpenCV website\cite{opencv_library}. This library was used without any modification.
