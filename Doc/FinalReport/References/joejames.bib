We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is taster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show how our technique can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision system.}},

@article{opticalFlowBirds,
    abstract = {{Although considerable effort has been devoted to investigating how birds migrate over large distances, surprisingly little is known about how they tackle so successfully the moment-to-moment challenges of rapid flight through cluttered environments [1]. It has been suggested that birds detect and avoid obstacles [2] and control landing maneuvers [35] by using cues derived from the image motion that is generated in the eyes during flight. Here we investigate the ability of budgerigars to fly through narrow passages in a collision-free manner, by filming their trajectories during flight in a corridor where the walls are decorated with various visual patterns. The results demonstrate, unequivocally and for the first time, that birds negotiate narrow gaps safely by balancing the speeds of image motion that are experienced by the two eyes and that the speed of flight is regulated by monitoring the speed of image motion that is experienced by the two eyes. These findings have close parallels with those previously reported for flying insects [613], suggesting that some principles of visual guidance may be shared by all diurnal, flying animals. º Birds regulate flight speed by monitoring induced image motion (optic flow) º Birds negotiate narrow passages safely by balancing lateral optic flow signals}},

A parallel implementation computes a distributed representation of image velocity. A measure of image-flow uncertainty is formulated; preliminary results indicate that this uncertainty measure may be used to recognize ambiguity due to the aperture problem. The model appears to deal with the aperture problem as well as the human visual system since it extracts the correct velocity for some patterns that have large differences in contrast at different spatial orientations.}},
