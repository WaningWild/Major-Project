What problems came up?
  - Drone SDK is very confusing, found an alternative called CVDrone, which acts as middleware to allow me to control the drone and implement computer vision easily. Not sure if it's a permanent fix or not, looking for supervisors approval. 
  - The CVDrone wouldn't install on my laptop due to an incompatible OS, had to change OS which was a major hassle in terms of installation (the iso's weren't loading, then my kernal was outdated and needed updating before I could get wifi, and we need wifi to connect to the drone)
  - Previous problems led to a massive slow down in drone control work + getting the output from the drones camera, although this is ALMOST complete.
  - I couldn't find time to read the papers, although I felt optical flow using spatio temporal filters may not be all that relevant.
